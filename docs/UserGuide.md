**Doritus** is an address book software for NUS teaching staff to manage student contacts. It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Doritus can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Doritus data.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts (students and teaching staff).

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com u/johndoe123 t/friends` : Adds a student.

   * `add staff n/Jane Smith` : Adds a teaching staff (tutor) with name only; phone, email, username and position use defaults.

   * `staffslist` : Lists only teaching staff. `studentslist` : Lists only students.

   * `tutorslot 2 mon-10-12` : Adds Monday 10:00–12:00 availability to the 2nd person in the list (must be teaching staff).

   * `tutordashboard` : Shows all teaching staff and their available time slots.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd person shown in the current list (works for both students and staff).

   * `export` : Exports all contacts to a CSV file.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Note:** At least one keyword or tag must be provided.

**Behavior:**

* **Name search:** Keywords match against person names (case-insensitive)
  * The order of keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
  * Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
  * Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search)

* **Tag search:** Tags match against person tags (case-insensitive)

**Format:** `export [f/FILE_PATH]`

**Parameters:**

* `f/FILE_PATH`: Optional. The file path where contacts should be exported. If not provided, exports to the default location (`./export.csv`).

**Behavior:**

* Exports all contacts (both students and teaching staff) in the current address book to a CSV file.
* If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
* The CSV file includes contact details such as name, phone, email, username, position, and tags.

* `export f/contacts.csv` — Exports contacts to `contacts.csv` in the current directory.
* `export f/backup/students.csv` — Exports contacts to `backup/students.csv`.

### Saving the data

Doritus data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Doritus data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, Doritus will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Doritus to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous Doritus home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
